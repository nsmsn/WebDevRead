## Diversity and Inclusion
Smashing Magazine: World Wide Web, not the Wealhty Western Web by Bruce Lawson. [Part One](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/world-wide-web-not-wealthy-western-web-part-1/) and [Part Two](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/world-wide-web-not-wealthy-western-web-part-2/)

NDIA: [AT&T’s Digital Redlining Of Cleveland](https://digitalinclusion.org/blog/2017/03/10/atts-digital-redlining-of-cleveland/) Maps based AT&T's own data to the FCC shows a "clear and troubling pattern": Long-term, systematic failure to invest in the infrastructure required to provide equitable, mainstream Internet access to residents of the central city (compared to the suburbs) and to lower-income city neighborhoods.

John Maeda: [2017 Design in Tech Report](https://designintechreport.wordpress.com/). Maeda believes that “design and inclusion are inseparable” and he is on a mission to prove that inclusive design is good business. “When we separate inclusion into essentially an HR compliance topic, it loses its energy,” Maeda said. “It’s important, of course, but it loses the creativity that’s intrinsic to inclusion.” 

Bryan Rieger: [Same same... but different](https://medium.com/@bryanrieger/same-same-but-different-ea8f872a54f#.970osmhb4).

## Security
Vicki Boykis: [What should you think about when using Facebook?](https://veekaybee.github.io/facebook-is-collecting-this/) We should already know this stuff, but at the same time its good to have all the various ways one company collects and uses data documented in one place.
